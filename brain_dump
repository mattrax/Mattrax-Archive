// This Is All My Ideas. I Am Trying To Move Them Out of Random Pleaces in the Code Files


//Remove All Evnly Formatted (Whietspaced) Structs
// APNS Make Device update Every * Days -> Configurable Checkin Timeout Cause Big Deployments Will Need Longer
// Does os.Exit(int) Run The Cleanup Functions If Not make it
// For Test, Test "gofmt -s -w ." And Break If It Does't Parse 100%
// FUTURE FEATURE: Redo Separator Between Blocks Of Function -> They Don't Stand Out Enought
// TODO: Contant Pinging Database To Stop HTTP Soon As It Stops Connecting
// TODO: Add "* Package Description: Something" To The Header of All Of The Files In a Package

// FIXME: Handle Device Removing From MDM Without Being In The Database

// Log Wiping After Restart (Fix That)
//      Redo Logging For Subfiles To Use The Features Of The New System
// TODO: Log File Roation So The Log Files Doesn't Get To Big
//      Config Options For External Logging Server
// TODO: Godoc Documentation Throughout Code -> On All Functions And Structs
// TODO: GoDEP Package Management
// TODO: Check Line Ending for ; and Remove (Maybe Add Test To Check For Them)
// TODO: Redo/Add Separators Between Part Of Code That Are Clean And Easy To See
//   Func Based (struct, err) Error Handling Insead Of *struct (Remove All Of *struct)
// Using The New Logging Information Log Structs/Varibles/State To mMake Debugging Easier (On log.Debug Only)
//TODO: Track Device Events (When They Enrolled, When They Checkin)
// Add Time Register To The Device Information
//  Lint/Test Check That Stuff Isn't Exports (Capitalised) Unless Used
// TODO: Update The Documentation URL In Each File To Match What is in It
// Disable File Logging, Log To Syslog

//Far In The Future
//   Build Tests -> For All Function And Routes (Fake Device Requests/Response Verifying)
