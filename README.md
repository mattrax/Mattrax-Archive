# Below Is Stuff For My Reference

## Notes For Other Developers
If You Do Go Development And Don't Agree With These Decision Please Create An Issue To Discuss It.

### Project Structure
This Projects File Structure Is Modelled After [Go Standard Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

### Web Frameworks/Routers
It Is Unclear To Me Whether It Is Idiomatic To Use A Web Router (Mux). I Eventually Decided On Using [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) Because It Is Fast And Makes Routing Alot Easier Than The Built In `net/http`.



### Objectives/TODO With The Rebuild
* Logging
* HTTP Routing/Handling
* HTTP Middlewear -> Logging, XSS, CORS, Authentication
* Database -> Access In HTTP Handlers
* Postges Triggers
